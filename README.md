## Summary of Game Design
Operation Climate Change teaches ten to twelve-year-olds about the social and ecological impacts of global warming.The goal is to provide 10 to 12-year-olds with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life relate to the global environment. They should develop an ability to change their behaviors and think critically about their communityâ€™s impact on climate change.
This game primarily teaches through its immersive storytelling. The premise of the story develops around our main character: the spy through a time travel journey to discover how climate change destroyed their futuristic community.
The game progresses through five main missions that cover a learning trajectory beginning with observing the global impact of climate change and ending with the knowledge needed to develop real-world solutions. The gameplay involves a mix of item gathering, simple puzzle solving, action, adventure/battle gameplay, and exploration. The basic gameplay controls stay consistent but solving puzzles become more challenging.

# Minimal Viable Product: Operation Climate Change Prototype

## Goals:

To create a prototype of our larger learning game that includes:
* The landing page or outer world of your game that shows what the overall game play is like. If you have a large world like Zelda, then you just need to make a small part of the world - enough for someone to understand what is going on and really illustrate the premise and feel of navigating your game.
* Necessary elements for game play like scores, health, etc. Describe what aspects you will include.
* Three levels or mini-games - one elementary level (potentially tutorial) and two intermediate levels, next to each other in difficulty. The purpose of this is to illustrate how you are going to teach an initial concept, how you teach more advanced content, and how you *gradually* increase difficulty to provide both practice and increasing difficulty. The three must be of those types - simple, intermediate, intermediate+1. They cannot be three completely disconnected topics or experiences - I need to see how you build gradually. This depends a bit on what your game is like. This could be two different mini-games instead of three, with one showing two sequential levels and the other being different. So look at your game and see what makes sense compared to the goals of this requirement.
