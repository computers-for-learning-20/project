# Computers for Learning Project: "Climate Change" Educational Game

This is the Project Repository for the "Climate Change" Educational Game

## Summary

Our game will teach about climate change and related environmental issues. Our goal is to provide 10 to 12-year-olds with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life relate to the global environment. They should develop an ability to change their behaviors and think critically about their communityâ€™s impact on climate change.  

We will cover earth science topics such as greenhouse gas emissions from various sources (e.g. fossil fuels, agriculture, industries), energy production, and the interdependence of natural systems. We will link these topics to social science ideas of capitalism, healthy consumer habits, and collective responsibility.

# Minimal Viable Product: Climate Change Game Prototype

## Goals:

To create a prototype of our larger learning game that includes:
* The landing page or outer world of your game that shows what the overall game play is like. If you have a large world like Zelda, then you just need to make a small part of the world - enough for someone to understand what is going on and really illustrate the premise and feel of navigating your game.
* Necessary elements for game play like scores, health, etc. Describe what aspects you will include.
* Three levels or mini-games - one elementary level (potentially tutorial) and two intermediate levels, next to each other in difficulty. The purpose of this is to illustrate how you are going to teach an initial concept, how you teach more advanced content, and how you *gradually* increase difficulty to provide both practice and increasing difficulty. The three must be of those types - simple, intermediate, intermediate+1. They cannot be three completely disconnected topics or experiences - I need to see how you build gradually. This depends a bit on what your game is like. This could be two different mini-games instead of three, with one showing two sequential levels and the other being different. So look at your game and see what makes sense compared to the goals of this requirement.
