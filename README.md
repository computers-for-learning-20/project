# Computers for Learning Project: "Climate Change" Educational Game

This is the Project Repository for the "Climate Change" Educational Game

**Work in Progress** :construction_worker:

## Summary

Our game will teach about climate change and related environmental issues. Our goal is to provide 10 to 12-year-olds with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life relate to the global environment. They should develop an ability to change their behaviors and think critically about their communityâ€™s impact on climate change.  

We will cover earth science topics such as greenhouse gas emissions from various sources (e.g. fossil fuels, agriculture, industries), energy production, and the interdependence of natural systems. We will link these topics to social science ideas of capitalism, healthy consumer habits, and collective responsibility.
